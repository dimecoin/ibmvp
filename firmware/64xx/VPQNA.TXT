Introduction

This document was created to assist IBM employees in solving problems
with the IBM Model 6384 PS/ValuePoint computer.  The information in this
manual will hopefully be a resource which will help IBM in giving
quality support to its customers.

The last page of this manual contains a summary of common system board
configuration questions.  This information was meant to be a faxable
document to customers.

This manual was compiled by gathering information from numerous manuals,
documents, and people.  Any additions, suggestions, or corrections
brought to the attention of the author would be very much appreciated.

This publication could contain technical inaccuracies or typographical
errors.  Changes will periodically be made to the information herein;
these changes will be incorporated in new editions of this publication.



Section I
System Board / ROM


1.  Definition of Local Bus

The I/O channel, where all I/O devices are located (i.e. video cards,
hard drive controllers, and serial adapters) operates at a given speed.
On most PC systems, including the PS/ValuePoint, the I/O channel runs at
8 MHz. This means that I/O devices, such as the built-in video
controller, runs at the speed of 8 MHz. The processor, on the other
hand, runs at a much higher speed.  For example the PS/ValuePoint
processor on the 6384-F00 model runs at 25 MHz. The ValuePoint's I/O
channel is the ISA or AT-BUS architecture.

The local bus technology incorporates two different types of I/O
channels.  The system board has the standard 8 MHz I/O slots that you
see on most ISA systems.  They also have "Local Bus" I/O slots.  The
local bus slots run at the speed of the processor, not 8 MHz. This
technology obviously increases the throughput of the machine.  There are
special local bus adapters that take advantage of the local bus
technology.  The two most common adapters for local bus slots are video
and hard drive controllers.

There are no IBM systems that incorporate the "Local Bus" technology (as
of the book).

2.  ROM BASIC on the ValuePoint system.

IBM computers have a certain amount of the BASIC programming language
built into the computer's ROM BIOS.  On most PS/2 systems, the size of
BASIC on the ROM chip is 32 Kb.  On the PS/ValuePoint systems, the ROM
BASIC is 5 Kb in size.

3.  With EMM386.EXE, you can include the address ranges.... (not official)

 C000-C7FF    (Free space that EMM386.EXE thinks is taken up by a video adapter)
 F725-FBFF    (ROM BASIC) * Note:QEMM includes F900-FDFF, so try that range.
 EA00-F1FF    (POST)
 B000-B7FF    (Mono video)* Note:Some high-res. video modes might use this
                            address range.  Windows 3.1 uses this range.
 E000-E7FF    (Video ROM)* Note:Only include if you install an OEM video
                                 card to override on board video

4.  The serial port UART chip is a 16450B.  The maximum speed of the serial port
 is 19,200 BAUD.

5.  DMA information - (not official)

According to the diagnostic program Checkit, there are eight DMA
channels, numbered 0-7.  DMA 2 is used by the floppy drive.  DMA 4 is
used by the cascade.

6.  The following are the model and sub model bytes for the ValuePoint machines.
..

                     Model  Sub model
        386SLC         F8    49
        486SX          F8    4A
        486DX & DX2    F8    4B


System Board/ROM

7.  The following is a list of the Interrupt assignments on the PS/ValuePoints.

        IRQ 0                Timer
        IRQ 1                Keyboard
        IRQ 2                Cascade Interrupt Requests (Possibly Video)

                IRQ 13        Math Coprocessor Exception
                IRQ 14        Fixed Disk
                IRQ 15        Available
        IRQ 3                Serial Alternate
        IRQ 4                Serial Primary
        IRQ 5                Available
        IRQ 6                Diskette
        IRQ 7                Parallel Port

8.  How do you run setup on the ValuePoint systems?

Press the F1 key during POST (boot-up) as the system is counting memory.
There is no reference or starter diskette for the ValuePoint.

9.  Processor upgrade information.

The 25/50 DX2 processor upgrade goes into the math coprocessor socket.
The 33/66 DX2 processor upgrade goes into the socket where the 486DX/33 processo
r is.

10.  The ValuePoint system has a beeper, NOT a speaker.

11.  There are five 16-bit expansion slots, 4 full length slots and 1
     half length slot.

12.  Adding serial (COM) devices on the ValuePoint.

You can have up to four COM ports on the PS/ValuePoint.  Setup will only
show two COM ports in the configuration screen, even if there are three
or four COM devices.

13.  The battery on the ValuePoints is a lithium battery.

14.  Power-on password information

You can enable a password on the ValuePoints through the configuration
utility built on the ROM chip.  Since anyone could make a password, some
customers may want the computer to not have the password setting
capability.  You can accomplish this by removing the power-on password
jumper from the system board.

15.  The DMA controller is a 24 bit controller.


Section II
Video


1.  Fastbios.sys

Fastbios.sys is a utility that comes with the 486 ValuePoint machines.
The driver is supposed to shadow the system's video BIOS.  Since the
video BIOS is already shadowed in RAM, there is no need to install this
driver.  The driver will not work on the ValuePoint systems.  The driver
was shipped by the video chip manufacturer in case a system did not
already shadow the video BIOS.

2.  OS/2 Preload flicker problem

The OS/2 2.00.1 preload video driver runs at 43.5 Hz Interlaced in SVGA
(1024x786) mode.  There is a video driver now available that runs at 70
Hz.  This driver also allows the customer to run in other modes such as
800x600.  The driver is available on the BBS, see the section
labeledOTHER for details.

3.  FST stands for Flatter Squarer Tube.  The 6319 is a FST monitor.

4. MFI stands for Mainframe Interactive.  The ValuePoints support MFI
    modes 2,3, and 4.

5.  Monitor support questions...

PS/ValuePoint supported monitors - 6312, 6314, 6319.  Any PS/2
                                   monitor except the 8506, 8508, 8517, and
                                   the 95xx series.
Will ValuePoint monitors work on Premier line -     Yes

As a rule of thumb, most VGA or SVGA compatible monitors will work on
the ValuePoints.

6.  CLMODE & VMODE

To set your computer in the right high resolution mode, you need to
configure either the CLMODE (for 386SLC) or the VMODE (for 486) program.
This is necessary to run your system in a high resolution mode (i.e.
800x600 or 1024x768).  Below are the "best" settings for each mode with
the PS/ValuePoint monitors in 1024x768 mode.

        6312 in 1024x768 -     CLMODE 3+ m5+  or  VMODE 65m

        6314,6319 in 1024x768 -    CLMODE 3+ m7+ or VMODE 72m

Important:  If you are going to run Windows high resolution drivers, you
            need to run CLMODE or VMODE before you run Windows.

7.  The PS/ValuePoint computers use DRAM video memory, not VRAM video memory.

    VRAM is generally faster but more expensive than DRAM.

8.  The NEC 3D monitor does not seem to work on the ValuePoint machines.


9.  Video chipset information...

    386SLC -    Cirrus Logic     CL-GD5422 (Compatible with Paradise)
    486 -        Tseng Labs     ET4000

10.  Video feature connector information.

    1.  The 386SLC, 486DX and 486DX2 feature connectors are pinned properly.
    2.  The 486SX connector is pinned to an Asian standard.
        You will need an interposer.

The feature connector was built for connectivity to OEM multimedia
solutions that use a feature connector.  The connector has not been
tested by IBM, and there are no IBM options that utilize the feature
connector.

11.  There is 1MB of Video DRAM on all ValuePoint models.

12.  Video accelerator card information...

A video accelerator card is a video card that is designed in such a way
to increase video performance.  The video built on the system board is
not a video accelerator.

13.  The following are the high resolution video modes you can use on
     the PS/ValuePoint systems...

    640x480 (16 colors)                at 60 & 72 Hz
    640x480 (256 colors)               at 60 & 72 Hz
    640x480 (up to 16 million colors)  at 60 Hz         Cxx model only
    800x600 (256 colors)               at 56, 60, & 72 Hz
    800x600 (up to 64K colors)         at 56 & 60 Hz    Cxx model only
    1024x768 (256 colors)              at 60 & 70 Hz
    1204x768 (256 colors)              at 87 Hz (interlaced)

14.   Monitor size information...

CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) manufacturers designate their tubes as 14 inch,
15 inch, etc.  The 15 inches they are referring to is the diagonal line
from one top corner of the glass to the opposite bottom corner.  When
the CRT is installed in a product such as the 6319, you loose some of
the glass since it is covered by the bezel.  If you measure the diagonal
it will be less than 15 inches.  We are following the industry by
quoting 15 inch nominal.

15.  Disabling the video on the ValuePoint systems.

To install a video card in the ValuePoint, you must disable the on board
video.  There are jumpers to accomplish this on the 486 ValuePoints.

    425SX model  -  Move JP10 from 1-2 to 2-3.  Remove JP1
    433DX & DX2 model - Move JP10 from 1-2 to 2-3.  Remove JP17
    325T model - Some systems have a jumper JP17, others do not have a video
                 disable jumper.


16.  All ValuePoint monitors meet the VLMF emissions standards.

17.  STB video accelerator card information

    -    The STB adapter is called the PowerGraph X-24 adapter
    -    It is a 16-bit adapter card.
    -    STB's phone number is 214-234-8750
    -    If you are using EMM386.EXE, include the address range E000-E7FF
    -    Supports up to 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution
    -    Supports up to 65,536 colors at 800x600 resolution
    -    The video is roughly 5 times as fast as standard SVGA
    -    Refer to pg. 1-3 of the STB manual if you are having video problems
         and you have a COM4 on the machine.

    -  The STB card is faster due to a video coprocessor that performs
       functions the processor normally does.  This includes a hardware cursor,
       line drawing, rectangle filling, high-speed image transfers, bit block
       transfers, support for no-wait video write operations, color expansion,
       and first-in-first-out (FIFO) data cache.

18.  OS/2 Video Driver Problem

There is a problem that may arise with the new 486 SVGA Video Drivers
for the ValuePoint using OS/2 2.00.1.  OS/2, with these drivers
installed, will experience video problems when changing video modes such
as in Communications Manager and OS/2 full screen modes.

The problem is due to a change in the vendor of a video frequency
controller chip on the system board.  This chip is located just left of
the TSENG video chip on the system board.  The older chip is labeled
"ICS" and the newer chip is labeled "CHRONTEL".  The OS/2 drivers are
written to handle the ICS chip but will not work correctly with the
CHRONTEL chip.  There is a new OS/2 video driver that will solve this
problem.


Section III
OS/2 Preload



2. There is a 0 MB partition on the ValuePoint computers.  It is Type
   FE.  You can delete it with FDISKPM.  Type FE partition is only required
   for European systems.

3.  DOS fax software does not seem to work under OS/2 2.00.1.

          FaxWorks, made by SoftNet, is an OS/2 fax program that does work.

4.  To put the OS/2 desktop in SVGA mode, you need to...

    1.    Click on the Welcome folder icon
    2.    Click on the Configuration Tools icon
    3.    Click on the Configure icon
    4.    Click on the box to the left of the Primary Display, then click on OK.
    5.    Choose SVGA as your display.

OS/2 Preload

5.  The OS/2 Support Matrix

    ValuePoint    1.30.1        1.30.2         2.0        2.0         2.00.1

    466DX/2      1,3            1,3            Yes        Yes        Preload

    Notes

      1 -    VGA mode only
      2 -    Requires "F-Disk error during boot" fix - Defect 57012
      3 -    Requires "Date/Time 162/163 error" fix - Defect 57146

6.  How to delete the OS/2 preload off the ValuePoint computer.

    1.  Make Utility Diskettes

    Obtain three 2M blank diskettes.  Locate the "Configuration Tools"
    icon in the Welcome Folder.  Open the Configuration Tools Folder.
    Locate the "Create Utility Diskettes" icon inside of the
    Configuration Tools icon view window.  Open and create the Utilities
    Diskettes.  The "Utilities Diskettes" window will appear.  Select
    the drive where the Utility Diskettes will be created.  Type "C" or
    place the mouse pointer on the "C" or place the mouse pointer on the
    "Create" and push the button and click once.  Follow the
    instructions on the screen to prepare the Utility Diskettes.  Label
    the diskettes 1,2, and 3.

    2. Delete OS/2 Preload

    Restart the system from the Utility Diskette (Place Utility Diskette
    #1 into Drive A, press Cntr-Alt- Del).  Place Diskette #2 and #3
    into the drive when instructed and press enter.  A command prompt
    should appear.  Place diskette containing OSDELETE.EXE into drive A.
    Type OSDELETE and hit enter.  When prompted "DO YOU WISH TO
    CONTINUE?" press "Y".  When prompted "DO YOU WISH TO STOP NOW?"
    press "N".  Type the system's serial number and press enter.
    OSDELETE will remove all files in the OS2 subdirectories.  Record
    the "VERIFICATION NUMBER" (Must have to get free DOS 5.0).  Press
    the enter key twice to return the OS/2 command prompt.

7.  There is a patch for AutoCad to work under OS/2.

    To get the file, you can contact AutoDesk or get the file OS2PCH.ZIP
    from the AutoCad forum nder Compuserve.


Section IV
Diskette Drives / Tape Drives


1.  Common diskette problems -

    - If the 'B' drive has a terminating resistor (T-Res) on it, you need
      to take it off.
    - The 'B' drive select should be on "1", the twist in the 'A' drive
       cable takes care of the drive select.
    - If a customer is having a problem with our 5.25 drive, make sure
      the customer knows to   push the drive button in to lock the diskette
        in the drive.

2.  OEM tape backup information.... (not official)

    Mountain File Safe 8000 will work under DOS.  It will not work under OS/2.

    Colorado Tape Jumbo 250 backup will work under DOS.  It will not
    work under OS/2, but they are working on drivers planned to be
    available by March 1993.

    Tecmar QT60I will work under DOS and OS/2.

3.  General diskette drive information...

    -    ValuePoints only support two diskette drives.
    -    The only 'B' drive option is a 1.2mb 5.25 drive.
    -    2.88 drive will not work.
    -    The drives are not Media-Sensing.
    -    You cannot make the 5.25 drive a bootable drive, or the 'A' drive.

4.  The floppy drive controller cannot be disabled.

5. If you are going to use the 2.0 gigabyte SCSI drive, you need to
    run the following Systos package.

    DOS machines    -    Systos 1.34
    OS/2 machines    -    Systos 1.35


Section V
Hard Drives


1.  What type of hard drives can you install in the ValuePoints systems?

    The standard hard drive interface is IDE.  You can install a SCSI
    adapter to run a SCSI hard drive.

2.  The IDE drives in the ValuePoints conform to the ANSICAM standard.

    If a customer purchases an OEM IDE drive, it needs to be an ANSICAM
    drive.  If an OEM drive does not work as a slave drive, that is a
    good tip that it is not an ANSICAM drive.

3.  If you install a second IDE drive, you need to set the Master/Slave jumper a
ccordingly.

    One drive needs to be the Master (C drive) and the other needs to be
    the Slave (D drive).

4.  How do you low-level format a hard drive?

    1.    Boot the advanced diagnostics diskette
    2.    Select system checkout
    3.    Select "Y" if the option list is correct
    4.    Select "Run Tests One Time"
    5.    Select Test #17
    6.    Select Format Menu
    7.    Select either Conditional or Unconditional format

5. The following is a list of the hard drive specs (heads,
    cylinders, access time, etc).

                   80MB            120MB              170MB            212MB

2.  You can have up to two SCSI adapters in the ValuePoint system.

3.  In order to have a SCSI drive a boot drive you need to make sure...

    1.There is no IDE drive in the system (the IDE primary drive will
      boot if you have a an IDE and a SCSI drive).

    2.The SCSI ID has to be set to ID 6.

4.  OS/2 and the SCSI adapter...

    OS/2 may lockup with the IBM AT-Bus SCSI adapter.  The solution is
    to have the SCSI adapter use an interrupt.  Jumpers W6 & W7 make the
    adapter to use IRQ 3 & IRQ 5 respectively.

5.  The 8-bit SCSI adapter information

    The 8-bit SCSI adapter is a TMC-850IBM adapter, manufactured
    exclusively for IBM by Future Domain.

   The configuration of the SCSI adapter is set up at the factory as follows...

        BIOS/Adapter Address:    CA00h (W1, W2 open)
        Interrupt select:        Disabled
        I/O Ports used:          None
        Termination Power:       Enabled (W4)
        Zero Wait State:         Disabled (W5)

    If you set W6 enabled, the card will use at IRQ 3. If you set W7
    enabled, the card will use IRQ 5.

6.  The 16-bit SCSI adapter information

    The 16-bit SCSI adapter is manufactured exclusively for IBM by
    Future Domain.

    The configuration of the SCSI adapter is set up at the factory as follows...

        BIOS/Adapter Address:    CA00h
        Interrupt select:        IRQ 5
        I/O Ports used:          0140-014F
        Termination Power:       Enabled



Section VII
Memory


1.  Wait states on the ValuePoint

    The ValuePoints uses 0-2 Wait States.  It uses 0 wait states if the
    processor finds its information in the cache memory.  It uses 0-2
    wait states if the processor needs to go to the RAM memory for data,
    depending on where in memory the data is located.

2.  Memory configurator...

386SLC

  1. Comes standard with 2 Mb memory soldered on the system board.
  2. Has two empty SIMM sockets on the planar.
  3. You can install the following memory SIMM sizes on the system board in any
order or
     combination...
                1 Mb, 2 Mb, 4 Mb, 8 Mb

    The memory is 72-pin IBM SIMMs (same memory as the PS/2 Model 35SX).
    The speed of the SIMMs can be 70,80, or 85 ns.  The memory will run
    at 85 ns on the system, regardless of the speed of the SIMM.

            1 Mb SIMM(85ns)    -    6450603
            2 Mb SIMM(85ns)    -    6450604
            4 Mb SIMM(80ns)    -    87F9977
            8 Mb SIMM(80ns)    -    6450129


486

    1.    There are eight SIMM sockets on the system board.
    2.    Memory must be installed in sets of four.
    3.    Each set of four must contain four 1 Mb SIMMs or four Mb SIMMs.

     The memory is 30-pin Industry Standard SIMMs.  The memory runs at 80 ns.

            1 Mb SIMM(80ns)    -    96F9290
            4 Mb SIMM(80ns)    -    96F9291

3.  My ValuePoint is not counting up all the memory I think it should because...

    486 Models
    The memory will count to 384 Kb less than the total memory
    installed.  ROM shadowing uses 128Kb of memory, whether it is
    enabled or disabled.  The other 256 Kb memory is not used by the
    system, and cannot be recovered.

    386SLC Model
    The memory will count to 128 Kb less than the total memory
    installed.  The 128 Kb is used for ROM shadowing.  When you disable
    ROM shadowing, you WILL get the 128Kb back.


Memory

4.  Hardware Memory Cache

    RAM memory on the ValuePoints is located on SIMM chips in sockets on
    the system board.  It takes a certain amount of time for the
    processor to retrieve information from the SIMM chips.  To speed up
    a computer's performance, system boards incorporate memory cache.
    Memory cache is high speed static RAM located either internally or
    externally to the processor.  The 386SLC, 486SX, 486DX, and 486DX2
    processors have 8kb of internal processor cache, called Level One
    cache.  The Mxx and W52 models have 128 Kb of external, or Level Two
    cache.  Level two cache is commonly known as L2 cache.  L2 cache
    normally runs around 15 to 17ns.

5. You can install up to 18 Mb of memory on the 386SLC, but the
    system will only recognize 16 Mb.

6.  The L2 Cache in the ValuePoints is not upgradeable.

7. There is a patch for OS/2 to recognize more than 16 Mb. Contact
    Defect Support for patch.

8.  Why memory has to be installed in sets of FOUR on the 486 ValuePoints.

    The memory SIMM is 8 bits wide.  There are four SIMMs in a bank.
    Memory is addressed in 32 bit paths. 4X8=32.


Section VIII
OTHER


1. The power supply is 145 Watts and you have a maximum of 10 Watts
    per adapter slot for adapter cards.

2.  Common power problems on the ValuePoints.

    Some systems will not power on or power off because the cover is
    not seated properly.

    The switch on the back of the power supply needs to be set to
    115V instead of the preset 230V.

    If a system does not have a hard drive light or a power light,
    check to see if the light cable is connected.

4.  ValuePoint as a desktop unit.

    IBM only officially supports the ValuePoint as a desktop unit.  The
    ValuePoint has not been UL tested as a tower unit (on it's side).

5. There is a patch to get a DCA Irma card to work on
    PS/ValuePoints.  Contact DCA.

6.  The ValuePoint systems will not work with Windows 3.1 32-bit disk access.

7.  Sales advisor & Marketing glossy mistakes...

    1.  The 120MB Tape Backup is not supported in the PS/ValuePoint systems.

    2. Sales Advisor has numerous errors, including the memory
       configurations on Pg.  C-9.

8.  The ValuePoint systems are Novell certified.

    ValuePoint as a server requires a Novell driver

    Novell 2.2 -    you need PS2ISA.COM, found in directory 33 on the BBS
    Novell 3.11 -    you need IDE386.EXE, found in directory 34 on the BBS

9.  The default keyboard scan code is set for SCAN CODE 2.

10.  Software packages that may have problems with the SLC
    processor.  (not official)

    1.  FoxPro
    2.  PCMoss


12.  We do not have any Mean Time Between Failure ratings for the
    ValuePoint systems.



13.  The following list are settings you can alter with the setup routine...

    1.  BIOS Shadowing (enable or disable)
    2.  Power on Password (enable or disable)
    3.  Startup sequence (either smart or conventional)

    Smart:If there is a non-bootable diskette in the A drive, it will
          ignore the disk and boot to the hard drive.

    Conventional:  If there is a non-bootable diskette in the A drive,
                   it will prompt you to put in a bootable diskette.

    4.  Serial Port (change COM ports or disable)

        ValuePoint Overview                11143
        Installation Instructions for Windows 3.1 drivers    12578

16.  DASD bay information...

  2    3.5" slim high bays    (one of these is for the 1.44 floppy)
  1    3.5" half high bay     (this bay is used by the hard drive)
  2    5.25" half high bays

Two of the 3.5" bays (1 slim high & 1 half high) are hidden, the rest are open.

17.  You can hit the ESC key to stop the memory from counting during POST.

18.  Several systems have been shipped without keys, need to order a new cover l
ock assembly.

19.  IRQ2 Interrupt Conflict

    The video on the ValuePoints use IRQ2 by default.  Some
    adapter cards such as Token- Ring adapters will conflict with the
    ValuePoint if the card uses IRQ2.  There is a jumper on most systems
    the will disable the video from using IRQ2 to free up the conflict.

   W52 & Mxx models - Jumper labeled JP305
   Fxx models - Jumper labeled JP17
   Cxx models -Jumper labeled JP16    (The first Cxx models were not built
                                with a JP16 jumper)

20.  Warranty information...

    1. The ValuePoint systems have a 1 year, On-Site warranty.  If a
    customer wants to purchase any kind of extended warranty, they can
    call the IBM Maintenance Department, 1-800- 624-6875.

    2. If a dealer needs to use the 30-Day Money Back Guarantee, the
    dealer needs to call 1-800-426-9733 to get the information and
    paperwork for the return.

21.  Where the serial number of the ValuePoint is located.

    1.    Under the key lock on the metal casing.
    2.    On the back of the unit.

22.  Emulation cards with DOS and EMM386.EXE

    If you use a memory manager program such as EMM386.EXE or
    QEMM386.EXE, you need to exclude the emulation card's ROM address
    and RAM address.  If you do not, some programs can load "on top of"
    the emulation card, causing unusual errors or lock-ups.

23.  Modem problems

    Modems use COM ports and IRQs (interrupt levels).  The modem could
    be conflicting with a serial port on the system board.  Change the
    COM port and/or the IRQ level of the modem to so it is not
    conflicting with the system.

24. SCO-Unix has a patch to get the operating system to work on the ValuePoint.
 Conact SCO-Unix.



25.  There is no 'Turbo' button or hardware device to slow down the processor.

    There is software programs available that will slow down the
    processor, usually found on bulletin board systems.

26.  The AutoCad drivers that come with the ValuePoint will work
    with AutoCad Release 12.

27.  The beeper on the ValuePoint is a Piezo beeper.

28.  The ValuePoints that come with the STB card are only available
    from DRM, 1-800-IBM-2YOU.

29.  Token-Ring RIPL problem hint.

    Try setting the Token-Ring card at an address higher than C800.

30.  Configuration change in the 6384-F20 ValuePoint.

    The F20 model used to come with an 80 Mb hard drive.  Now it comes
    with a 120 Mb hard drive.  Dealer can return the 80 Mb version for
    120 Mb by calling 1-800-426-9733.  This has to be done before
    February 26, 1993.  You must ship all your returns in ONE shipment.

31.  The ValuePoints systems and monitors are FCC Class 'B' certified.

32.  If a ValuePoint does not work on a cold boot, and works on a
    warm boot, check to see if DOS is IBM.

    There have been numerous problems with MS-DOS on the ValuePoint.

33.  If you are going to use a Token Ring II adapter and EMM386, put
    a parameter D=100 in the config.sys.

    The D=100 parameter allocates 100 kb of DMA buffer for the Token-Ring II ada
pter.

34.  If you are having 162 & 163 errors on ValuePoints with OS/2,
    try the following steps...

    1.Download CLOCK01.SYS from the BBS in Directory 36
    2.Delete the CLOCK01.SYS from the OS2 directory on the ValuePoint
      hard drive.
    3.    Copy your new CLOCK01.SYS to the OS2 directory.
    4.    Shutdown
    5.    Cold boot the machine TWICE.

35.  The mouse is a 200 D.P.I. (dots per inch) mouse.

36.  Foxpro issues with the SLC processor (325T computer)

    Foxpro 2.0 could hang on the SLC chip.  To get around this, try to
    load Foxpro in expanded memory.  Foxpro 2.5 should work fine on the
    SLC chip.

37.  Lotus has a patch for 3.1 and 3.1+.  Contact Lotus for details.
     IT STILL REQUIRES EMM386 FOR SOME REASON.
