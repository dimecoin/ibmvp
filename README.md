This is a wiki on the [IBM Value Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/ValuePoint) series of computers.  A lot of this information is becoming more difficult to find, so thought I would document my findings when researching my own system.  I'm mostly concerned with the 6482 model, but will gladly take pull requests or information from others.
